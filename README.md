#### Description
Most of the times, companies during interview process, are promising you that you will work on a codebase 
where Scala language, is being used as a lesser Haskell, but in reality, it is used as a better Java and for the hype only unfortunately.

So as time goes by, you become rusty on the FP constructs, theory and techniques that you have learnt.

This repo serves this purpose ==> to provide a quick refresher on some topics about fp in Scala.
